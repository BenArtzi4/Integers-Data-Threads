# Integers-Data-Threads

### Welcome to the Integers Data Class program, written in Java!

This program defines a data class that contains two integers and has two methods:

update(int dx, int dy): This method updates one of the integers in the data class to the value of newNumber.

getdiff(): This method returns the difference between the two integers in the data class.

The program also defines two threads that operate on an instance of the data class. These threads have been implemented with a synchronized system to ensure that they run alternately.

The program will output the difference between the two integers in the data class as the threads operate on it.
